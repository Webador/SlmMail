[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/JouwWeb/SlmMail/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/JouwWeb/SlmMail/?branch=master)

SlmMail is a module that integrates with various third-parties API to send mails. Integration is provided with the
API of those services. It does _not_ handle SMTP.

Here are the currently supported services:

* [Elastic Email](http://elasticemail.com) (complete)
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) (complete)
* [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) (complete)
* [Postage](http://postageapp.com) (complete)
* [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) (nearly complete)
* [SparkPost](http://sparkpost.com) (nearly complete)
* [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses) (nearly complete, attachments are missing)
* [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com) (complete, but please don't use this party, as Mailchimp / Mandrill do not actively maintain this service)

Installation
------------

1. First install the repo: 

   `composer require slm/mail`
    
   - For Laminas MVC add `SlmMail` in your `application.config.php` file.
   - For Mezzio it should prompt whether we want to autoconfigure. Accept this. 

2. In order to use a mail service, you now need to configure it. We have provided a sample configuration file per mail server.

   Copy the sample configuration file to your autoload directory. For example for _Mandrill_ one would use
   
   `cp vendor/slm/mail/config/slm_mail.mandrill.local.php.dist config/autoload/slm_mail.mandrill.local.php`
  
   Please tweak the dummy contents in this file. This file will contain the credentials.

Usage 
-----

One can now fetch the dependencies from the service manager. And now compose a message:

```php
$message = new \Laminas\Mail\Message();
$message
    ->setTo('send@to')
    ->setFrom('send@by')
    ->setSubject('Subject')
    ->setBody('Contents');

$mandrillService = $container->get(\SlmMail\Service\MandrillService::class);
$mandrillService->send($message);
````

Cook-book
---------

### How to send an HTML email ?

Every email providers used in SlmMail allow to send HTML emails. However, by default, if you set the mail's content
using the `setBody` content, this content will be considered as the plain text version as shown below:

```php
$message = new \Laminas\Mail\Message();

// This will be considered as plain text message, even if the string is valid HTML code
$message->setBody('Hello world');
```

To send a HTML version, you must specify the body as a MimeMessage, and add the HTML version as a MIME part, as
shown below:

```php
$message = new \Laminas\Mail\Message();

$htmlPart = new \Laminas\Mime\Part('<html><body><h1>Hello world</h1></body></html>');
$htmlPart->type = "text/html";

$textPart = new \Laminas\Mime\Part('Hello world');
$textPart->type = "text/plain";

$body = new \Laminas\Mime\Message();
$body->setParts(array($textPart, $htmlPart));

$message->setBody($body);
```

> For accessibility purposes, you should *always* provide both a text and HTML version of your mails.

### `multipart/alternative` emails with attachments

The correct way to compose an email message that contains text, html _and_ attachments is to create a 
`multipart/alternative` part containing the text and html parts, followed by one or more parts for the attachments. See
the [Laminas Documentation](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mail/message/attachments/#multipartalternative-emails-with-attachments)
for a full example.

### How to configure HttpClient with http_options and http_adapter

By default the adapter is Laminas\Http\Client\Adapter\Socket but you can override it with other adapter like this in your slm_mail.*.local.php

```php
'slm_mail' => array(
    // Here your email service provider options

    'http_adapter' => 'Laminas\Http\Client\Adapter\Proxy' // for example
)
```

If you want to change some options of your adapter please refer to you adapter class in var $config [here](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-http/tree/master/src/Client/Adapter) and override these in your slm_mail.*.local.php like this :

```php
'slm_mail' => array(
    // Here your email service provider options

    // example for Socket adapter
    'http_options' => array(
        'sslverifypeer' => false,
        'persistent' => true,
    ),
)
```

### Which provider should I choose?

We won't answer you :-)! Each provider has their own set of features. You should carefully read each website
to discover which one suits your needs best.
