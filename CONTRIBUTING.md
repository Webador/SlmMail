# How to contribute to SlmMail?

First of all, thank you very much for contributing to SlmMail. We don't ask you a lot: just make sure you follow
Zend Framework 2 code style conventions. If your PR introduce a new feature, we will ask you one or more unit tests
to ensure the code will work correctly in the future. Additionally, we may ask you to add a tiny paragraph of
documentation, depending on the change!

# How pull requests are handled?

SlmMail is currently maintained by Jurian Sluiman (@juriansluiman) and MichaÃ«l Gallego (@bakura10). Excepting for
typo/docblock fixes that can be merged by any of us, any other PR will require approval from both of us. This is to
ensure high quality code.

Therefore, don't worry if we take a few days to merge your change!
